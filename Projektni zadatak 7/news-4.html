			<h2>The clubs Luis Suarez couldn't sign for and other bizarre contract clauses</h2>
			<p>Luis Suarez and Manchester United were at odds for much of the Uruguayan's time with Liverpool, mostly focusing around the episode in which the forward was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra, yet it has emerged that there was a clause in his transfer to Barcelona that prevented him from ever signing for the Old Trafford club.</p>
			<p>It's difficult to imagine there ever being any interest in Suarez from Manchester United for the reasons mentioned above, but it wasn't something either Liverpool or Los Cules would risk.</p>
			<p>In a story published by the Mirror, it is detailed how this clause was embedded into Suarez's contract with the Blaugrana, preventing him from signing for Manchester United.</p>
			<p>It's understood that he would have also been unable to join United, even on a free transfer after his contract at the Camp Nou expired.</p>
			<p>Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid were also believed to have been clubs in the same boat, unable to sign Suarez.</p>
