			<h2>Haaland revives the war between Real Madrid and Barcelona</h2>
			<p>Ironically, Real Madrid and Barcelona both want the same thing, Florentino Perez and Joan Laporta both want the same thing, and that is to secure the signing of Erling Haaland.</p>
			<p>On the pitch the height of the rivalry came during the Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola era, with some of the developments in Clasico matches being nothing short of a disgrace, yet off the pitch there is now going to be a battle to sign the Borussia Dortmund star.</p>
			<p>The German club are desperate for the 21-year-old to make a clear decision on his future before the end of January, not because they want to lose him immediately but rather they want to kickstart their planning for the 2022/23 season in the knowledge of how much money they will have to spend.</p>
			<p>Laporta is known to be a cold operator in the transfer market - you have to remember that he has already met with Mino Raiola on two occasions - and he was able to sign Ferran Torres under the cover of night when everyone believed the deal to be dead.</p>
			<p>Real Madrid and Florentino Perez are operating a little more openly, as they have made no secret of the fact that their number one target is Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe, who they plan to sign on a Bosman deal on July 1.</p>
