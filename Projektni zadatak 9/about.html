		<p>Having spent the majority of my life as a fan of Real Madrid, I recently found myself sitting with a friend and talking about why I even got into this in the first place.</p>
		<p>As a young kid, I found myself enamored by Zinedine Zidane playing with France and I remember telling my dad that I wanted to buy a football jersey.</p>
		<p>We went to a small store together and the man there asked me what jersey I wanted and my only response was: “Zidane”.</p>
		<p>He preceded to give me the number 5 jersey of the legend at Real Madrid and that’s when things began for me.</p>
		<p>Over the many years that followed, I watched Real Madrid more with each passing season until it reached a point where the games were my priority and everything else could wait.</p>
		<p>This may sound a little exaggerated, but I lose count of arguments I have had in previous relationships where plans were about to be made and just like a business man would respond with “let me check my schedule”, my response was, “let me see what time the game is on that day”.</p>
		<p>That’s just how it was for a while before I got into beginning my career and being able to organize my time well.</p>
        <p>I still do everything in my power to not miss a Real Madrid match.</p>
		<p>As the years went on, it became apparent to me that being a supporter of Real Madrid and football, in general, teaches you a lot that you tend to use in your everyday life.</p>
