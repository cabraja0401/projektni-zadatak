			<h2>Real Madrid cool interest in Antonio Rudiger</h2>
			<p>Real Madrid are no longer interested in signing Chelsea centre-back Antonio Rudiger, who they had previously been targeting on a free transfer as his current contract is set to expire next summer.</p>
			<p>The German defender is free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with another club as he has less than six months remaining on his deal at Stamford Bridge, and he has been linked with the likes of Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, as well as Real Madrid.</p>
			<p>According to Jose Luis Sanchez on the El Chiringuito Twitch channel, however, Los Blancos are no longer in the hunt.</p>
			<p>The club have cooled their interest in Rudiger and will not be following up with a formal offer, although they have had discussions with the player's representatives.</p>
