			<h2>Ancelotti: Bale doesn't feel right, but he isn't injured</h2>
			<p>Carlo Ancelotti has spoken ahead of Real Madrid's match against Alcoyano and he provided an extensive update on the injury and COVID-19 status of his players.</p>
			<p>The Italian explained that Vinicius will be back from COVID-19 but unlikely to play and that Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and Ferland Mendy join Dani Carvajal and Gareth Bale on the medical report.</p>
			<p>In the case of Bale, though, he doesn't have a specific injury and the coach was asked what is wrong with the Welshman.</p>
			<p>"Bale doesn't feel right, but he isn't injured," Ancelotti said.</p>
			<p>Moving on to talk about the Copa del Rey opponents, who knocked Real Madrid out at this same stage last season, Ancelotti insisted he and his players will take this game seriously.</p>
